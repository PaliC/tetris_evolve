Our primary selection is trial_8_0, which achieved the best known solution (2.6359850561146603) through high-precision arithmetic and sophisticated optimization techniques. We're also carrying forward our second-best performer (trial_7_7) as a strong alternative and two diverse approaches (trial_8_5 and trial_7_2) that offer different techniques and perspectives. This selection balances exploiting our best solution while maintaining diversity for potential further improvements or insights. Having effectively reached the best known solution, we're now well-positioned to investigate the theoretical underpinnings of this optimal configuration.",
