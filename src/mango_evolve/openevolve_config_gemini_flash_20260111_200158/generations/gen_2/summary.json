The selections include our overall best performer (trial_1_0), along with four trials that showcase complementary approaches: progressive constraint relaxation (trial_2_4), boundary-aware initialization (trial_2_6), physics-based simulation (trial_2_1), and problematic circle refinement (trial_2_2). Together, these selections cover all the most promising techniques identified in our analysis while maintaining high baseline performance. Future generations should aim to combine these approaches, particularly by integrating the multi-start strategy from trial_1_0 with the progressive constraint relaxation from trial_2_4 and the specialized optimization techniques from the other selections.",
