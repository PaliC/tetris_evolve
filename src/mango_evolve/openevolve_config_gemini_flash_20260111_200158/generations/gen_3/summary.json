The selections include our new best overall (trial_3_9), two other strong Generation 3 performers with different strengths (trial_3_0 and trial_3_4), our unique physics-based simulation (trial_3_2), and our previous best from Generation 1 (trial_1_0) to maintain continuity. Together, these selections cover the most promising techniques identified in our analysis: multiple initialization strategies, progressive constraint relaxation, targeted small circle refinement, explicit boundary handling, and physics-based simulation. We're now just 0.01 away from the best known solution (2.636), and these selections provide multiple promising paths to potentially reach it.",
