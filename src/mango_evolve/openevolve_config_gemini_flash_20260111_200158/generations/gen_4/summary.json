Our highest scoring solution remains trial_3_9 from Generation 3, which we've retained along with the best of Generation 4 (trial_4_1). We're also carrying forward three solutions with distinctive approaches: region-based optimization (trial_4_8), specialized handling of different circle types (trial_4_6), and physics-based simulation (trial_3_2). The analysis suggests we may be approaching a plateau near the theoretical optimum, so exploring these diverse methodologies could help us overcome local optima and potentially reach the best known solution of 2.636.",
