The selection includes our first optimal solution (trial_8_0) plus three Generation 9 solutions that offer complementary strengths: a generalizable approach that works for any number of circles (trial_9_3), a focused implementation with visualization capabilities (trial_9_7), and a solution with deep theoretical insights (trial_9_9). These selections provide both optimal performance and valuable conceptual diversity, allowing us to understand not just how to solve this specific problem, but the broader mathematical principles of circle packing.",
