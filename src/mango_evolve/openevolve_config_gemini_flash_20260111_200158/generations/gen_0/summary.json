The physics-based approach (trial_0_3) shows particular promise despite its current lower score, as it offers a fundamentally different way to approach the problem that could be combined with elements from the higher-scoring trials. Together, these selections provide a strong foundation of both proven performance and conceptual diversity for future generations.",
