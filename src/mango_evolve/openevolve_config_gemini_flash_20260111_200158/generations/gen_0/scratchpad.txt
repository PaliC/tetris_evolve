# Circle Packing Evolution Notes

## Generation 0 Insights

### Top Performers:
- trial_0_9: Score 2.549783
- trial_0_7: Score 2.333391 
- trial_0_8: Score 1.679239

### Approaches Used:
- The top performing approach (trial_0_9) appears to use a hybrid strategy
- Second best (trial_0_7) uses an equal-sized circles approach
- Third best (trial_0_8) uses a multi-strategy approach

### Observations:
- 5 out of 10 trials were invalid, suggesting algorithmic errors are common
- A range of approaches were tried, with hybrid/combined methods performing best
- The best score (2.549783) is still below the known best solution (2.635985)

### Potential Areas for Improvement:
- Refining optimization techniques
- Better handling of constraints
- More sophisticated positioning strategies
- Combinations of successful approaches
