Trial_1_0, the clear leader, uses a multi-start optimization strategy that demonstrates the power of trying multiple initialization approaches. Trial_1_4 offers a physics-mathematical hybrid that could provide new insights. Trial_1_6 brings a unique incremental approach to managing complexity. Additionally, retained trial_0_9 from Generation 0 as it represents the original mathematical foundation that led to our top performer and provides continuity. Together, these selections balance exploiting what's working well (mathematical optimization with good initialization) with exploring alternative approaches (physics-based methods and incremental optimization).",
