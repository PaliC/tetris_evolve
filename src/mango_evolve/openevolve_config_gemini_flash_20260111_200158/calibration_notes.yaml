  ## Model Observations


  ### Claude 3.7 Sonnet

  - **Mathematical reasoning**: Excellent conceptual understanding with precise explanations

  - **Code quality**: Clean, well-commented code with thorough edge case handling

  - **Problem solving**: Methodical step-by-step reasoning with geometric insights

  - **Instruction following**: Follows complex multi-part instructions faithfully

  - **Best uses**: Deep reasoning tasks, complex problem decomposition, code generation
  that requires careful edge case handling

  - **Temperature**: Works best at 0.2-0.5 for technical tasks; higher temps don''t
  significantly improve creativity


  ### Gemini 2.0 Flash

  - **Mathematical reasoning**: Good but sometimes less precise than Sonnet

  - **Code quality**: Functional but occasionally misses edge cases

  - **Problem solving**: More direct approaches, sometimes missing nuanced optimization
  opportunities

  - **Instruction following**: Generally follows instructions but occasionally misses
  parts of multi-step requests

  - **Best uses**: Quick implementations, straightforward reasoning tasks

  - **Temperature**: Shows more variance between low (0.1) and high (0.9) temperatures
