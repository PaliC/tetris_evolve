Selected top 4 performers representing different optimization strategies: trial_1_1 (best, needs refinement focus), trial_1_11 (dual_annealing), trial_1_3 (greedy order), trial_1_7 (hybrid). Next gen should focus on: (1) fine-tuning trial_1_1's approach, (2) combining best elements from top solutions, (3) more aggressive local search around the best configuration found.",
