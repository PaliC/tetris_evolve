Selected top 4: trial_2_1 (best, needs final push), trial_2_6 (DE approach at 2.628), trial_2_15 (Voronoi-guided at 2.627), trial_2_12 (basin hopping at 2.625). Next generation must focus INTENSIVELY on trial_2_1 - the remaining gap of 0.0017 suggests we need: (1) more optimization iterations, (2) tighter tolerances, (3) more restarts around current best, (4) possibly exact geometric calculation of optimal positions.",
