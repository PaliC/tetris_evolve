This suggests either: (1) trial_3_0's configuration is genuinely hard to reproduce due to random seeds, or (2) we're not correctly passing the best config forward. CRITICAL INSIGHT: The children are NOT starting from trial_3_0's actual configuration - they're re-running code that uses random seeds! For Gen 6: (1) I need to actually EXTRACT the exact 26 center coordinates from trial_3_0 and HARDCODE them, (2) Apply perturbations to those EXACT coordinates, (3) Stop relying on random seed reproduction.",
