  "selection_reasoning": "Gen 4 FAILED to beat trial_3_0 (2.6343). Major issues: 7 timeouts (iterations too high), 3 overlap errors. Key lessons: (1) Our refinement iterations were WAY too high - need to cap at 20K max, (2) Many optimizers failed to improve beyond our best, (3) trial_3_0's configuration is in a good basin but we can't quite reach optimal. Next gen: (1) Extract EXACT coordinates from trial_3_0, (2) Use FAST optimizers with LOW iteration counts, (3) Try ensemble methods - run many short optimizations rather than few long ones, (4) Focus on analyzing the structure of trial_3_0 vs known optimal.",
