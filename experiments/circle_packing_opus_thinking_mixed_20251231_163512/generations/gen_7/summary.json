Micro-optimization from 2.6343 is NOT working - we're in a very tight local optimum. For Gen 8: (1) Must use MUCH shorter iteration counts (cap at 5000), (2) Try LARGER perturbations or completely different starts, (3) Maybe explore from trial_4_9's different basin (2.6323), (4) Consider that optimal config might have fundamentally different structure than our 5x5+1 grid.",
