This confirms our hypothesis: we were stuck in a suboptimal basin. Gen 4 strategy: (1) Intensive refinement of trial_3_0 with very fine moves, (2) Extract exact configuration and apply multiple optimization methods, (3) Try even larger perturbations to see if we can find an even better basin. The gap is now just 0.064% - we're extremely close!",
