Key learnings: (1) Use gemini-flash or sonnet instead of opus for code generation - fewer formatting errors, (2) Need fundamentally different approaches to escape this local optimum, (3) Consider: the optimal configuration may have qualitatively different structure - perhaps asymmetric or with very different circle sizes. Next gen should try: completely different initializations, looking up known configurations for n=26, and ensemble methods.",
