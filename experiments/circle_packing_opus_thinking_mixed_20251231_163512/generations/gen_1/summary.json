Focus next generation on: (1) intensive refinement of trial_1_15, (2) combining VNS with other successful approaches, (3) using trial_1_15's configuration as initialization for other optimizers. Several timeouts suggest need to limit iteration counts. The gap is now just 0.0050 - we're very close!",
