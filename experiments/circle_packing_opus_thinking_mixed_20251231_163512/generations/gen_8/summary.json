The key insight: different random seeds find COMPLETELY different local optima. Seed 42 found 2.6343, but seed 7777 found the near-optimal basin. Gen 9 strategy: (1) Try seeds near 7777 (7770-7780), (2) Apply micro-optimization to trial_8_15's configuration, (3) Try more diverse seeds. We're essentially AT the optimal now!",
