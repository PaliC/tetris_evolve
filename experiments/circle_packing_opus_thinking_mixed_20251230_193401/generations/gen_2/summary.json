The genetic algorithm's ability to escape local optima combined with SLSQP repair was key. For next generation: (1) refine trial_2_8 with more generations/population, (2) combine GA with slack elimination, (3) try extracting trial_2_8 positions and further optimizing. Only 0.23% gap remaining to target.",
