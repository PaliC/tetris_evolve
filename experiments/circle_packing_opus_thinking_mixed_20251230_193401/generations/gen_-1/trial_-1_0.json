  "response": "# Finding the Minimum Side Length of a Square Containing Three Unit Circles\n\n## Setting Up the Problem\n\nI need to place three circles of radius 1 inside a square, where each circle touches exactly two sides of the square. A circle touching two sides must be positioned at distance 1 from each of those sides, meaning its center is at distance 1 from both sides.\n\n## Analyzing Possible Configurations\n\nFor a circle to touch exactly two sides, it must be placed in a corner (touching two adjacent sides). There are 4 corners in a square, and I need to place 3 circles.\n\n**Key constraint:** The circles cannot overlap, so the distance between any two centers must be at least 2.\n\n## Configuration Analysis\n\nLet the square have side length $s$ with corners at $(0,0)$, $(s,0)$, $(s,s)$, and $(0,s)$.\n\nCircle centers at each corner would be at:\n- Corner A (bottom-left): center at $(1, 1)$\n- Corner B (bottom-right): center at $(s-1, 1)$\n- Corner C (top-right): center at $(s-1, s-1)$\n- Corner D (top-left): center at $(1, s-1)$\n\n**Distances between adjacent corner centers:** $s - 2$\n\n**Distances between diagonal corner centers:** $(s-2)\\sqrt{2}$\n\n## Finding the Minimum Side Length\n\nIf I place circles in three corners, I need to check:\n- **Adjacent pairs** (like A-B, B-C, or A-D): distance = $s - 2 \\geq 2$, so $s \\geq 4$\n- **Diagonal pair** (like A-C): distance = $(s-2)\\sqrt{2} \\geq 2$, so $s \\geq 2 + \\sqrt{2}$\n\n**Case 1: Three corners including a diagonal pair (e.g., A, B, C)**\n- A to B (adjacent): $s - 2 \\geq 2$\n- B to C (adjacent): $s - 2 \\geq 2$  \n- A to C (diagonal): $(s-2)\\sqrt{2} \\geq 2$\n\nThe binding constraint is $s \\geq 4$.\n\n**Case 2: Can we do better with a non-corner configuration?**\n\nWhat if one circle touches two *opposite* sides? That's impossible for a circle of radius 1 unless $s = 2$, which is too small for three circles.\n\n**Case 3: Optimized asymmetric arrangement**\n\nLet me try placing two circles in opposite corners (A and C) and one circle in another position touching two adjacent sides but not in a corner.\n\nPlace circles at A $(1,1)$ and C $(s-1, s-1)$.
