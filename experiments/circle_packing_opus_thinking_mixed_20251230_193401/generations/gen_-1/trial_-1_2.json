  "prompt": "Solve this geometry problem: Three circles of radius 1 are placed inside a square such that each circle touches exactly two sides of the square. What is the minimum side length of the square? Show your reasoning.",
  "response": "To find the minimum side length of the square, we must determine the most efficient configuration for three circles of radius $r=1$ such that each circle touches exactly two sides of the square.\n\n### 1. Identifying the Configuration\nLet the square be defined on a Cartesian plane with vertices at $(0,s), (s,s), (s,0),$ and $(0,0)$, where $s$ is the side length.\nFor a circle of radius 1 to touch two sides of a square, its center must be exactly 1 unit away from those two sides. There are four such possible positions for the centers:\n*   **$C_1$ (Bottom-Left):** $(1, 1)$\n*   **$C_2$ (Top-Left):** $(1, s-1)$\n*   **$C_3$ (Top-Right):** $(s-1, s-1)$\n*   **$C_4$ (Bottom-Right):** $(s-1, 1)$\n\nSince we have three circles, we must choose three of these four positions. Due to the symmetry of the square, any selection of three corners is equivalent. Let's place the centers at $C_1(1, 1)$, $C_2(1, s-1)$, and $C_3(s-1, s-1)$.\n\n### 2. Establishing the Constraint\nFor the circles to be \"inside\" the square without overlapping (or just touching at the minimum side length), the distance between any two centers must be at least $2r = 2$.\n\nWe calculate the distances between the chosen centers:\n1.  **Distance between $C_1$ and $C_2$:**\n    $$d(C_1, C_2) = \\sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (s-1-1)^2} = \\sqrt{(s-2)^2} = s-2$$\n2.  **Distance between $C_2$ and $C_3$:**\n    $$d(C_2, C_3) = \\sqrt{(s-1-1)^2 + (s-1-(s-1))^2} = \\sqrt{(s-2)^2} = s-2$$\n3.  **Distance between $C_1$ and $C_3$:**\n    $$d(C_1, C_3) = \\sqrt{(s-1-1)^2 + (s-1-1)^2} = \\sqrt{(s-2)^2 + (s-2)^2} = (s-2)\\sqrt{2}$$\n\n### 3. Solving for $s$\nTo ensure no two circles overlap, the distance between every pair of centers must be $\\ge 2$.\n*   From $d(C_1, C_2) \\ge 2$: $s - 2 \\ge 2 \\implies s \\ge 4$.\n*   From $d(C_2, C_3) \\ge 2$: $s - 2 \\ge 2 \\implies s \\ge 4$.\n*   From $d(C_1, C_3) \\ge 2$: $(s-2)\\sqrt{2} \\ge 2 \\implies s-2 \\ge \\sqrt{2} \\implies s \\ge 2 + \\sqrt{2}$.\n\nSince $4 > 2 + \\sqrt{2}$ (because $4 > 3.414$), the strictest constraint is $s \\ge 4$.\n\n### 4. Conclusion\nIf $s=4$, the circles at the adjacent corners ($C_1, C_2$ and $C_2, C_3$) touch each other, while the circles at the opposite corners ($C_1, C_3$) are separated by a distance of $2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.828$, which is greater than 2.\n\n**Minimum side length:** $4$",
