  "prompt": "Solve this geometry problem: Three circles of radius 1 are placed inside a square such that each circle touches exactly two sides of the square. What is the minimum side length of the square? Show your reasoning.",
  "response": "I need to find the minimum side length of a square that contains three circles of radius 1, where each circle touches exactly two sides of the square.\n\n## Understanding the Configuration\n\nSince each circle touches exactly two sides of the square, each circle must be positioned in a corner of the square. With three circles and four corners, three corners will have circles and one will be empty.\n\n## Setting Up Coordinates\n\nLet me place the square with vertices at (0,0), (s,0), (s,s), and (0,s), where s is the side length.\n\nFor a circle of radius 1 to touch two sides of a corner:\n- A circle in the bottom-left corner has center at (1,1)\n- A circle in the bottom-right corner has center at (s-1,1)\n- A circle in the top-left corner has center at (1,s-1)\n- A circle in the top-right corner has center at (s-1,s-1)\n\n## Finding the Constraint\n\nWithout loss of generality, let's say the three circles are in:\n1. Bottom-left corner: center at (1,1)\n2. Bottom-right corner: center at (s-1,1)\n3. Top-left corner: center at (1,s-1)\n\nThe square is minimized when the circles are as close together as possible. Since the circles cannot overlap, the constraint is that any two circles must have their centers at least distance 2 apart (sum of their radii).\n\n## Checking Distances\n\nLet me check the distances between centers:\n\n**Distance between bottom-left and bottom-right:**\n$$d_1 = \\sqrt{(s-1-1)^2 + (1-1)^2} = s-2$$\n\n**Distance between bottom-left and top-left:**\n$$d_2 = \\sqrt{(1-1)^2 + (s-1-1)^2} = s-2$$\n\n**Distance between bottom-right and top-left:**\n$$d_3 = \\sqrt{(s-1-1)^2 + (s-1-1)^2} = \\sqrt{2(s-2)^2} = (s-2)\\sqrt{2}$$\n\n## Applying the Non-Overlap Condition\n\nFor the circles not to overlap, we need all distances \u2265 2:\n\n1. $s-2 \\geq 2 \\Rightarrow s \\geq 4$\n2. $s-2 \\geq 2 \\Rightarrow s \\geq 4$\n3. $(s-2)\\sqrt{2} \\geq 2 \\Rightarrow s-2 \\geq \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow s \\geq 2+\\sqrt{2}$\n\nThe binding constraint is $s \\geq 4$ (since $4 > 2+\\sqrt{2} \\approx 3.414$).\n\n## Verification\n\nWith $s = 4$:\n- Distance between adjacent corner circles: $4-2 = 2$ \u2713\n- Distance between diagonal corner circles: $(4-2)\\sqrt{2} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\approx 2.83 > 2$ \u2713\n\nAll circles fit without overlapping, and each touches exactly two sides of the square.\n\n## Answer\n\nThe minimum side length of the square is **4**.",
