The remaining 0.003 gap to 2.636 likely requires: (1) finding a DIFFERENT configuration structure that GA hasn't discovered, or (2) the problem fundamentally requires more circles in different positions. 3 more timeouts - need to keep computation lean. For Gen 5: try radically different structures, or accept we may have found a strong local optimum.",
