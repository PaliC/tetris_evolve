The winning strategy (trial_3_14) combined GA with slack elimination - confirming hybrid approaches are key. Two trials timed out (300s) from scaled-up GA - need to balance computation time vs exploration. For next generation: (1) refine trial_3_14 with more slack elimination passes, (2) extract exact positions and do intensive local search, (3) try even finer perturbations. Only 0.11% gap remaining!",
