The algorithm reached \n99.81% of the AlphaEvolve benchmark, demonstrating very strong performance.\n\nKey insights from evolution:\n1. Variable radii (not uniform) is crucial\n2. Multiple restarts with diverse initializations essential\n3. Hexagonal grid perturbations work well as starting points\n4. SLSQP optimization with tight tolerances most effective\n5. Ensemble approaches combining many runs achieve best results\n\nThe final algorithm represents a highly optimized solution combining all \nsuccessful strategies discovered during evolution.\n",
