Interestingly, niter=100 (trial_12_0: 2.6238) and niter=150 (trial_12_1: 2.6308) performed WORSE - more iterations not always better due to random path sensitivity. The winning formula is niter=50 with seed=42. Gap to target remains 0.00000014 (1.4e-8). This may be numerical precision limit. Gen 13 should try: exact reproduction with tiny variations, different T parameter, or accept we've essentially solved it.",
