  "selection_reasoning": "Major breakthrough! Top 4 trials all above 2.59, with best at 2.616 (only 0.02 from target). The improved multistart (trial_1_4) and tangent calculations (trial_1_10) both work well. SLSQP with proper constraints (trial_1_3) is reliable. Physics simulation (trial_1_5) provides algorithmic diversity. Many failures were due to overlaps - the successful trials all have robust constraint handling. Next generation should focus on fine-tuning these top approaches to close the remaining 0.76% gap.",
