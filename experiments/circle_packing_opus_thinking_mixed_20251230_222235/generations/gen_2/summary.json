SLSQP refinements also improved to 2.622. Several timeouts suggest we need to be careful about computational cost. Next generation should focus on: (1) refining the tangent construction further, (2) combining tangent initialization with aggressive SLSQP, (3) trying even more iterations/restarts within time budget.",
