Carrying forward 3 strong performers from generation 3 (trial_3_0, trial_3_5, trial_3_2) to maintain diversity. Key lesson: next generation must balance optimization quality with execution time - avoid requesting 50+ restarts or 100k+ iterations. Focus on efficient algorithms with smart parameter tuning rather than brute-force approaches.",
