Generation 6 showed continued improvement (+0.0033) with trial_6_6's precision-focused ensemble approach proving most effective. Key insight: larger ensemble sizes (40 runs) with ultra-tight tolerances (1e-12) are closing the gap. We are now only 0.28% away from the 2.635 target. Next generation (7 of 10) should focus on: (1) Further scaling trial_6_6's ensemble approach (50-60 runs), (2) Even tighter numerical tolerances (1e-13 to 1e-14), (3) Combining trial_6_6's ensemble with trial_6_8's sequential refinement, (4) Final micro-optimizations to close the remaining 0.0074 gap.",
