Selected a mix of: refined scipy (trial_3_0), force-directed hybrid (trial_3_5), ensemble approach (trial_3_2), multi-method hybrid (trial_3_12), and ultra-tuned scipy (trial_3_7). We're making steady progress: +0.0489 (gen 0\u21921), +0.0021 (gen 1\u21922), +0.0056 (gen 2\u21923). Next generation should focus on: even tighter tolerances, more extensive restarts, and careful numerical precision to close the final 0.0215 gap.",
