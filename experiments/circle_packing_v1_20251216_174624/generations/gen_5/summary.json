Strong convergence continues: +0.0489 (gen 0\u21921), +0.0021 (gen 1\u21922), +0.0056 (gen 2\u21923), +0.0050 (gen 3\u21924), +0.0058 (gen 4\u21925). All top 5 selections scored above 2.61, showing robust high performance. The hybrid approach (trial_5_2) combining progressive tightening with multi-restart is proving most effective. Next generation should focus on: micro-optimizations of trial_5_2, even tighter tolerances, and careful numerical precision to close the final 0.0107 gap and exceed the 2.635 target.",
