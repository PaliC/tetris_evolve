The top 3 performers (2.6058, 2.5941, 2.5828) all show different optimization strategies that can be further refined and hybridized. Added trial_1_13 for algorithmic diversity (iterative expansion) and trial_1_9 for its multi-resolution potential. Note: Several trials timed out, suggesting overly complex approaches - we should focus on efficient algorithms that complete quickly while maintaining high quality.",

This breakthrough result shows the power of combining global search (force-directed) with local refinement (scipy). Must be refined further to push even higher.",
