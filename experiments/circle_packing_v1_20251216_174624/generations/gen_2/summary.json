Added trial_2_12 for its unique analytical gradient method and trial_2_6 for its comprehensive three-stage pipeline. We're now at 98.97% of target (2.6079/2.635), with only 0.0271 gap remaining. The next generation should focus on micro-optimizations: better parameter tuning, longer optimization runs, and careful constraint handling to close this small gap.",
