CRITICAL ISSUE: Progress has essentially stalled - improvement dropped from +0.0033 (gen 5\u21926) to +0.0002 (gen 6\u21927), an 87% slowdown. Multiple trials converged to the same score (2.6276), suggesting we've hit a local optimum. With only 3 generations remaining (8, 9, 10), we need a strategic pivot: (1) More aggressive exploration with different initialization patterns, (2) Alternative optimization methods (genetic algorithms, particle swarm), (3) Hybrid global-local search strategies, (4) Accept that we may be near the practical optimum for gradient-based methods. The remaining 0.0072 gap (0.27%) may require fundamentally different approaches or indicate we're at the limit of this optimization landscape.",
