  "selection_reasoning": "Generation 3 achieved another breakthrough with trial_3_3 reaching 2.6261, now 99.66% of the AlphaEvolve benchmark (only 0.0089 gap). Selected top 4 performers, all scoring above 2.621. Key insight: trial_3_3's success comes from hybridizing trial_2_5's adaptive structure with trial_2_0's diverse initializations - proving that combining successful approaches is more effective than refining a single approach. The progression shows steady improvement: 2.6228\u21922.6235\u21922.6261 over three generations. Strategies that worked: (1) Hybrid approaches combining multiple successful methods, (2) Progressive multi-phase refinement (60\u219215\u21925), (3) High-precision optimization with tight tolerances, (4) Micro-adjustments and aggressive local search, (5) Coordinate descent for fine-tuning. With only 0.0089 remaining (0.34%), we're extremely close to the benchmark. Next generation should focus on: ultra-fine-tuning trial_3_3 with even more aggressive micro-optimization, combining trial_3_3's hybrid approach with trial_3_4's micro-adjustments, exploring numerical precision limits, and potentially trying ensemble methods that average or select from multiple near-optimal solutions.",

This is a hybrid approach combining trial_2_5's adaptive multi-start structure with trial_2_0's diverse initialization strategies. Uses 60 initializations in phase 1, refines top 15 with maxiter=400, then top 5 with maxiter=1000, followed by aggressive local search. Only 0.0089 from benchmark (99.66% of target).

This is an enhanced sequential refinement building on trial_2_3 with 6 phases (80\u219220\u21928\u21923\u2192coordinate descent\u2192radius expansion). The multi-phase progressive refinement with coordinate descent is a valuable approach that achieved the same score as our previous best, showing robustness.",

The emphasis on numerical precision with incremental radius expansion (0.01% steps) is a different approach that nearly matches the best. Worth exploring further refinement.",

While not the top scorer, this micro-adjustment strategy is fundamentally different and could be combined with trial_3_3's hybrid approach for even better results. The 100-iteration micro-optimization loop is a valuable technique.",
