## CALIBRATION OBSERVATIONS
(See original calibration notes above)

## GENERATION 0 RESULTS ANALYSIS

### Performance Summary
- Best: trial_0_15 (2.599) - Analytical tangency approach (opus)
- 2nd: trial_0_12 (2.571) - Scipy SLSQP optimization (opus)  
- 3rd: trial_0_3 (2.535) - Physics simulation (gemini-flash)
- Target: 2.636 (gap: 0.037 from best)

### Critical Issue: 10/16 trials INVALID due to overlaps
Most failures were overlap violations. Constraint satisfaction is critical.

### What Worked:
1. **Analytical tangency** (0_15): Explicitly placing circles tangent to walls and each other
2. **Scipy optimization** (0_12): Constrained optimization with SLSQP
3. **Physics repulsion** (0_3): Soft repulsion forces pushing circles apart

### What Failed:
- Hexagonal grids without proper spacing adjustment
- Hierarchical/recursive approaches without overlap checks
- Genetic algorithms without strong constraint enforcement
- Voronoi approaches (overlap issues)

### Key Learnings:
1. Must validate constraints DURING construction, not just at the end
2. Tangency-based placement naturally avoids overlaps
3. Optimization needs good initial guess + constraint handling
4. Physics simulation can work but needs careful tuning

### Strategy for Gen 1:
1. REFINE top performers: trial_0_15, trial_0_12, trial_0_3
2. HYBRID: Combine analytical initialization with optimization
3. CONSTRAINT FOCUS: Add explicit overlap repair mechanisms
4. More opus for complex refinement tasks
