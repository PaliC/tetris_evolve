## CALIBRATION OBSERVATIONS

### Geometric Reasoning Test (temperature 0.3)
All three models correctly solved the geometry problem (3 circles in square, answer s=4).

**opus**: Most thorough exploration - tried multiple configurations, verified all cases, clearest verification step. Very systematic "Case 1, Case 2, Case 3" approach.

**sonnet**: Equally correct, slightly more concise. Good structure with clear sections. Direct path to solution.

**gemini-flash**: Well-structured with numbered sections. Good mathematical notation. Equally rigorous.

**Verdict**: All three have excellent geometric/mathematical reasoning. No significant difference in accuracy.

### Code Generation Test (various temperatures)

**opus (temp 0.7)**:
- Most thorough validation (NaN, infinity, None checks)
- 13 comprehensive test cases
- Excellent docstrings and comments
- Uses squared distances (good optimization)
- Most verbose but most robust

**sonnet (temp 0.5)**:
- Clean, well-structured code
- Good validation with helpful error messages
- 9 test cases covering edge cases
- Good balance of thoroughness and conciseness
- Uses epsilon for floating point comparison

**gemini-flash (temp 0.9)**:
- More concise implementation
- Good structure with clear comments
- Noted computational efficiency (mentioned Quadtree for scaling)
- Uses epsilon (1e-12) for precision
- Included practical efficiency considerations

### STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR EVOLUTION

1. **gemini-flash** (cheapest: $0.50/$3 per M tokens)
   - Best for: Exploratory variations, creative mutations, high-volume exploration
   - Temperature: 0.7-0.9 for diversity, 0.3-0.5 for refinement
   - Strength: Good code quality at 10x lower cost

2. **sonnet** (mid-range: $3/$15 per M tokens)
   - Best for: Balanced quality tasks, general purpose work
   - Temperature: 0.3-0.5 for reliable output
   - Strength: Good balance of quality and cost

3. **opus** (premium: $5/$25 per M tokens)
   - Best for: Critical refinements, complex reasoning, final optimization
   - Temperature: 0.2-0.4 for precision
   - Strength: Most thorough, best for difficult challenges

---

### TEMPERATURE GUIDELINES
- 0.0-0.3: Focused, reproducible, best for refinement
- 0.4-0.6: Balanced creativity/focus
- 0.7-1.0: More creative/diverse, good for exploration

### KEY OBSERVATIONS
- All models understand geometry constraints well
- All produce working code with proper validation
- All use good practices (squared distances, epsilon for floats)
- No model significantly outperformed others on basic tasks
- Cost difference is the main differentiator for basic tasks
