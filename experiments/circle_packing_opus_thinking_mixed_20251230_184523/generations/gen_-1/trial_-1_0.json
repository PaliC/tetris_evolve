  "prompt": "Pack 4 identical circles into a unit square to maximize total radius. What is the optimal arrangement?",
  "response": "I need to find how to pack 4 identical circles of maximum radius into a unit square.\n\n## Analyzing Possible Arrangements\n\nFor 4 identical circles, there are two main candidate arrangements:\n\n### 1) Grid Arrangement (2\u00d72)\nPlace circles at the centers of four equal quadrants.\n\nEach quadrant is a 1/2 \u00d7 1/2 square. The circle in each quadrant must fit within it, so:\n- Center positions: (1/4, 1/4), (3/4, 1/4), (1/4, 3/4), (3/4, 3/4)\n- Each circle must stay within its quadrant\n- Distance from center to edge = 1/4\n- Maximum radius: **r = 1/4**\n\n### 2) Diamond/Rotated Arrangement\nCould we do better with an asymmetric arrangement? \n\nFor 4 circles, we might try placing 3 along one edge and 1 opposite, or other configurations. However, by symmetry arguments and the constraint that we want to maximize the radius of identical circles, the symmetric 2\u00d72 grid is optimal.\n\nLet me verify the 2\u00d72 arrangement is indeed optimal:\n- The circles touch each other when 2r = distance between centers\n- Distance between adjacent centers = 1/2\n- So circles touch when r = 1/4\n- Distance from each center to nearest wall = 1/4\n- So r = 1/4 is exactly the maximum before hitting walls\n\n## Verification\n\nWith r = 1/4:\n- Each circle just touches the two nearest walls of its quadrant\n- Adjacent circles just touch each other at points like (1/2, 1/4)\n- All space is optimally used\n\n## Answer\n\nThe optimal arrangement is a **2\u00d72 grid** with circles centered at:\n- (1/4, 1/4)\n- (3/4, 1/4)  \n- (1/4, 3/4)\n- (3/4, 3/4)\n\n**Maximum radius: r = 1/4**\n\nThe total diameter of each circle equals 1/2, and the four circles tile perfectly in a square arrangement.",
