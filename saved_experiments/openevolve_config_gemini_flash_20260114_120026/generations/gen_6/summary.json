The top three selections represent our best-scoring solutions across generations, all using variations of basin-hopping but with different implementations of adaptive parameters, step sizes, and temperature controls. The two diversity selections introduce valuable alternative techniques: a physics-based simulation and a hierarchical/topology-aware approach. In the next generation, we should continue refining these high performers while also exploring hybrid approaches that combine elements from different trials, particularly the adaptive mechanisms from trial_6_0 with the topology-aware optimization from trial_6_9.",
