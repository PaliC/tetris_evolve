We're carrying forward the best overall physics-based approach (trial_0_2) along with our best mathematical optimization approach from Generation 4 (trial_4_0). We've included three additional trials that represent different algorithmic approaches and strong performance. The high timeout rate in Generation 4 suggests we should focus on implementation efficiency in the next generation while combining the strengths of different approaches - particularly the physics-based simulation from trial_0_2 with the sophisticated initialization and multi-phase optimization from trial_4_0.",
