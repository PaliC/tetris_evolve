Our selections include: (1) the best overall physics-based approach from Gen 0, (2) pattern-based initialization with post-optimization refinement from Gen 3, (3) grid-based placement with local refinement, (4) multi-stage optimization with penalty functions, and (5) a symmetry-exploiting approach that reduces search dimensionality. This combination maintains our best performer while exploring diverse algorithmic strategies that could lead to breakthroughs in future generations through hybridization or refinement.",
