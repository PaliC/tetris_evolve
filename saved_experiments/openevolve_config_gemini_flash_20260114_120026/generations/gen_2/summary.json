The high failure rate in Gen 2 (7 out of 10) indicates implementation challenges with complex algorithms. The selected trials represent three categories: (1) top performers with proven effectiveness, (2) potential-rich approaches from Gen 2 worth refining, and (3) algorithmic diversity to prevent premature convergence. Our best trial remains trial_0_2 from Gen 0, suggesting we should focus on careful refinement rather than radical changes in our next generation.",
