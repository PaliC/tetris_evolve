While none of the current generation trials exceeded our historical best, trial_11_1 came close with its sophisticated multi-stage optimization. The selection maintains our best-performing algorithms (trial_8_2 and trial_10_1) while incorporating novel geometric approaches with trial_11_7 (pattern-based) and trial_11_3 (Voronoi + physics). The diverse techniques in these trials provide complementary strategies that could lead to breakthroughs when combined or refined in future generations.",
