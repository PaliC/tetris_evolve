The top two selections (trial_0_2 and trial_0_7) demonstrate effective optimization techniques with strong performance, while the other selections bring valuable diversity through simulated annealing and greedy placement strategies. For the next generation, we should explore hybrid approaches that combine the structured initialization from trial_0_7 with the optimization techniques from trial_0_2 or the simulated annealing from trial_0_1. We should also improve constraint handling and implement multi-stage optimization to escape local optima.",
