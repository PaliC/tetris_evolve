  "selection_reasoning": "Generation 12 had a high failure rate (7/10) but introduced some interesting approaches. Our selection maintains our two best performers while incorporating the most promising new methods. The multi-stage optimization from trial_12_7 and hexagonal grid initialization from trial_12_5 represent different conceptual approaches that could potentially be strengthened. For future generations, we need to address the code generation and constraint violation issues that caused many failures. We should focus on more robust implementations, clearer prompting, and better constraint handling mechanisms.",
