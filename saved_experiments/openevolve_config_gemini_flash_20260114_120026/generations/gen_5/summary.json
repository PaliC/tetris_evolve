Our new best is trial_5_8 (score: 2.633035) using basin-hopping with multiple initialization strategies and custom step functions, which surpasses our previous best. We're also maintaining algorithmic diversity by keeping the physics-based approach (trial_0_2) that was previously our best, along with a hybrid approach (trial_5_1) that combines physics-based initialization with optimization. The hierarchical strategy (trial_5_4) offers a different conceptual framework that could be promising with further refinement. This selection balances exploitation of our best findings with exploration of diverse methods that could yield further improvements.",
