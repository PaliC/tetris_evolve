  "selection_reasoning": "The selections balance exploitation of high-performing approaches with exploration of novel techniques. The top three trials (8_2, 8_5, 8_3) all scored above 2.63 and use variations of basin-hopping with multi-stage optimization, adaptive parameters, and sophisticated initialization strategies. Trial 8_9 introduces constraint relaxation techniques that add valuable algorithmic diversity. Trial 8_4 brings a completely different Voronoi-based approach with blue noise distribution that, despite its lower current score, introduces geometric principles that could lead to breakthroughs with further refinement.",
