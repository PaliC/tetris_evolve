  "selection_reasoning": "We've selected a strategic mix of high-performing trials and diverse approaches. Our selections include the best overall trial (trial_8_2) and one of the top performers from Generation 10 (trial_10_1). We've avoided duplicating nearly identical approaches (trial_10_1 and trial_10_5), instead selecting for more diversity with the incremental placement approach (trial_10_3), an alternative basin-hopping implementation (trial_5_8), and the physics-based approach (trial_0_2). This balance allows us to continue refining our best performers while maintaining algorithmic diversity to escape potential local optima. We appear to have reached a score plateau around 2.634, suggesting we need this mix of exploitation and exploration to make further progress.",
