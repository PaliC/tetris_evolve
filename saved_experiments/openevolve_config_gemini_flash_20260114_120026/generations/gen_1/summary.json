We're carrying forward the best overall trial from Generation 0, the two top performers from Generation 1, and two additional trials that offer distinct approaches. Key techniques represented include physics-based simulation, informed initialization strategies, two-stage optimization processes, and diverse radius refinement methods. The hybrid approaches show particular promise, especially those that combine smart initialization with dedicated radius refinement steps.",
