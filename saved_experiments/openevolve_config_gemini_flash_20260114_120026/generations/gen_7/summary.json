It also maintains algorithmic diversity by including a hybrid physics-based approach (trial_7_2) and the original physics simulation (trial_0_2). The high failure rate in Generation 7 suggests we need to be cautious with complex implementations, focusing on robust approaches that can be incrementally improved. This balanced selection provides both strong performance baselines and diverse algorithmic approaches to explore in the next generation.",
