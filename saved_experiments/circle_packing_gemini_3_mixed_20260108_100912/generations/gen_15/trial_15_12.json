No, that's worse.\n    Let's use the $5 \\times 5$ grid and put the 26th circle at `(0.99, 0.99)`.\n\n    ```python\n    x, y = np.meshgrid(np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, 5), np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, 5))\n    centers = np.vstack([x.ravel(), y.ravel()]).T\n    centers = np.vstack([centers, [0.99, 0.99]])\n    ```\n    This is a decent start.\n\n    One last thought: Should I use `method='L-BFGS-B'`?\n    No, `L-BFGS-B` is for *box* constraints only. We have *nonlinear* constraints (the overlap).\n    So `SLSQP` or `trust-constr` are the main choices. `SLSQP` is generally faster.\n\n    Wait, I just realized that `r` can be a single value if I want to maximize $26r$.\n    But the problem says \"maximize the sum of their radii\", and the best known solution might have slightly different radii.\n    However, the difference will be very small.\n    Let's stick with 26 radii.\n\n    Wait, I should make sure my `centers` and `radii` are the right shape.\n    `centers` should be `(26, 2)`, `radii` should be `(26,)`.\n    My `final_params[:2*n].reshape((n, 2))` and `final_params[2*n:]` will give that.\n\n    One more thing: the constraints should be *strictly* satisfied.\n    Sometimes SLSQP can leave very small violations.\n",
