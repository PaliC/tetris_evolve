NO explanation. NO 'Here is the code'. \nJust the code.",
  "response": "25$.\n\n    Let's use the provided strategy and the SLSQP optimization.\n\n    Wait! I just found the $2.635985$ value again!\n    It's for **$n=26$ equal circles** in a unit square where the sum is $26 \\times r$.\n    But the value $r = 0.10138404$ is for **$n=25$** circles in a $1.01384 \\times 1.01384$ square? No.\n    Wait, $r = 0.10138404$ is the radius for $n=24$ equal circles in a unit square!\n    $24 \\times 0.10138404 = 2.433$.\n    $26 \\times 0.10138404 = 2.63598504$.\n    So the sum $2.6359850561146603$ is $26 \\times r_{24}$.\n    This would mean that 26 circles of radius $r_{24}$ can fit in a unit square.\n    But that's impossible, because even 25 circles of radius $r_{24}$ cannot fit (the max radius for $n=25$ is $0.1$, and $0.10138404 > 0.1$).\n\n    So the only way the sum is $2.635985$ is if the radii are different.\n    Let's use the SLSQP optimization starting from a $5 \\times 5$ grid.\n\n    Wait, I have a better idea for the starting point:\n    Use 25 circles in a $5 \\times 5$ grid, but shrink them to $r=0.095$.\n    Then you have room to put the 26th circle and move everything.\n\n    ```python\n    import numpy as np\n    from scipy.optimize import minimize\n\n    def construct_packing():\n        n = 26\n        # Start with a 5x5 grid (25 circles)\n        x = np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, 5)\n        y = np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, 5)\n        xv, yv = np.meshgrid(x, y)\n        c25 = np.vstack([xv.ravel(), yv.ravel()]).T\n        # Add 26th circle\n        c26 = np.array([[0.5, 0.5]]) # Middle\n        centers = np.vstack([c25, c26])\n        \n        # Jitter the centers slightly to break symmetry\n        np.random.seed(42)\n        centers += np.random.normal(0",
