## Generation 1 Strategy
- **Critical Fix**: Enforce strict code block formatting to prevent invalid trials.
- **Lineage A (Physics)**: Refine `trial_0_3`.
    - Add "thermal noise" (jitter) to prevent jamming.
    - Implement "variable inflation": inflate smaller circles faster to equalize, or vice versa.
- **Lineage B (Resurrection)**: Re-attempt Scipy global optimizers (Basin Hopping, Diff Evo) which failed due to formatting.
- **Lineage C (Geometric)**: Try Voronoi relaxation again, as it's a standard high-performance heuristic for this domain.
